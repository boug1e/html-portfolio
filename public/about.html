<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, I'm Mason Bourgeois and I'm a junior at Louisiana State University. 
  I'm currently learning Software Engineering, and hope to become a successful full
  stack engineer.

  specifically programming with C in linux. I have programming experience in the 
  following languages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java, C, C++</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>I've taken courses such as:</p>

</ul>

<p>I have previous work experience with computers. For the past few years, I've been a 
  summer intern at VeraPro, who specialize in IT for school networks.
